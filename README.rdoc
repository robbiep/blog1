= Blog1

This is my first complete Rail application.

I have been using Blogger as my platform to demonstrate my knowledge of computer science and software development. It has been a good experience, but it is time to take my knowledge one step further... it is time for me to build an entire website from scratch with Rails.

This application is a simple blog which should demonstrate my understanding of full-stack web development.

The purpose is to use minimal support from available libraries, and to do as much leg work as possible to create the application without wasting time. So for example, I am writing my own admin interface, but using Foundation  for much of my CSS.
